## [2025-06-30] - Initial Setup
### Added
- Created project directory structure
- Added RULES.md with project guidelines
- Added PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with game specifications
- Initialized CHANGELOG.md for tracking progress
- Created basic Python package structure:
  - Created `rpg_game/` directory
  - Added `__init__.py` for package initialization
  - Added `game.py` for main game classes
  - Added `main.py` for game entry point

## [2025-06-30] - Location Class Implementation
### Added
- Implemented `Location` class in `game.py` with the following features:
  - Tracks location name and description
  - Manages exits to other locations
  - Handles presence of tools, crystals, and droids
  - Provides descriptive text output

A1. Functional Implementation & Gameplay Logic: 7-8/10 marks
Critical Issues:

游댮 Hazard Logic is Flawed: The rubric mentions "hazard counter increases logically according to gameplay events," but your implementation only increments hazards when trying to move east while the droid is present. This is overly specific and doesn't reflect realistic hazard mechanics.
游댮 Missing Game Exit: Your help mentions "quit" command, but it's not implemented. Players can only exit with Ctrl+C.
游리 Golden Path Dependency: The game only works if players follow the exact sequence. What if someone tries to pick up the crystal first? The game allows it, breaking the intended challenge.
游리 Inconsistent Game State: The DamagedMaintenanceDroid class exists but isn't properly integrated - you create temporary instances instead of managing the actual droid state.

A2. Object-Oriented Design & Principles: 6-7/10 marks
Significant Design Problems:

游댮 Broken Encapsulation: Location class attributes like exits, has_tool, etc. are public when they should be private. Any code can modify these directly.
游댮 Unused/Dead Code: You create self.diagnostic_tool and self.energy_crystal instances that are never used - this is wasteful and confusing.
游댮 Poor Droid Design: The DamagedMaintenanceDroid isn't properly integrated. You create a temporary instance just to call repair() on it, then ignore it completely. This violates object-oriented principles.
游댮 Mixed Responsibilities: Player class handles both player state AND game commands (move, pick_up_tool, etc.). This violates Single Responsibility Principle.
游리 Weak Polymorphism: Only the examine() method shows polymorphism. A robust design would have more polymorphic behavior.
游리 Type Hints Inconsistency: You use 'Location' forward reference but don't need it since Location is defined earlier.

A3. Code Craftsmanship & Readability: 3-4/5 marks
Code Quality Issues:

游댮 Redundant Documentation: Many docstrings just restate what the code obviously does:
pythondef remove_tool(self) -> bool:
    """Remove the tool from this location if present."""
This adds no value beyond the method name.
游댮 Magic Numbers: Hard-coded values (10, 20, 50, 30) scattered throughout without constants or configuration.
游리 Inconsistent Error Messages: Some methods print errors, others don't. Some return bool, others don't use the return value consistently.
游리 Poor Game Loop Design: The main game loop in start_game() is a basic infinite while loop with no proper state management.
游리 Input Parsing: Command parsing with string slicing (command[5:].strip()) is primitive and error-prone.

Additional Critical Problems:
Architecture Issues:

Tight Coupling: Player class directly references Location internals instead of using proper interfaces
Global State Problems: Game state is scattered across multiple objects without clear ownership
No Input Validation: Beyond basic existence checks, there's no validation of game state consistency

Missing Features from Professional Code:

No logging or debugging capabilities
No configuration management
No proper exception handling hierarchy
No unit test considerations in design
No extensibility for adding new items/locations

Revised Assessment: 16-19/25 marks
Why This Doesn't Deserve Top Marks:

Functional Issues (7/10): While it works, there are logical flaws and missing features that prevent it from being "flawless."
Poor OOP Implementation (6/10): Significant violations of OOP principles, mixed responsibilities, and broken encapsulation patterns.
Mediocre Craftsmanship (3/10): Redundant documentation, magic numbers, and inconsistent patterns throughout.

To Reach Excellence (23-25/25), You Need:

Fix encapsulation - make Location attributes private with proper getters/setters
Implement proper droid management - don't create temporary objects
Separate concerns - move command handling out of Player class
Add missing quit functionality
Replace magic numbers with named constants
Improve documentation quality - explain WHY, not WHAT
Add proper input validation and error handling

This is competent student code, but not professional-grade software. The rubric's "extensive/thorough" level requires sophisticated design choices that aren't present here.
